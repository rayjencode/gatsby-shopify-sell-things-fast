# Sell Things Fast

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3bdc46c0-850a-4bbd-af34-2b7f16d7f181/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sell-things-fast/deploys)

This repo is an exploration of building a Shopify store on top of Gatsby. It features Theme UI as the theming engine, and deploys to Netlify.

You're welcome to fork or clone this repo; however, I would recommend checking out [gatsby-theme-shopify-manager](https://gatsbythemeshopifymanager.com) to see if that is more useful than this code is!
